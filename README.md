## 💬 About Me

I'm Marley and I took a chance on myself and completely changed gears in my career! I know React, JavaScript, Node.js, CSS and more! Always interested in learning new concepts and making dreams a reality!

👆 Ask me how I got into web development!

Programming has taught me to be brave when approaching new concepts and treading the unknown. I've learned the most through trying stuff out, and asking LOTS of questions!
