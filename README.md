- 💻 **Currently studying** for my AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam

## 💬 About Me

I'm Marley and I took a chance on myself and completely changed gears in my career! From working with kids to working with code, I have learned so much! I know Typescript, React, JavaScript, Node.js, Contentful CMS, AWS and more! I'm always interested in learning new concepts and making dreams a reality!

👆 Ask me how I got into web development!

Programming has taught me to be brave when approaching new concepts and treading the unknown. I've learned the most through trying stuff out, and asking LOTS of questions! 

*“The man who asks a question is a fool for a minute, the man who does not ask is a fool for life.”*
